# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What this app can do?

This aplicattion can add, mark as done and remove tasks than you got to do.  You can add writing the name or description of it, then clicking on the "agregar tarea" button; when you do the task, can make click on her and automatically the color it's going to change and the text it's going to be with a line trought. When you whant to remove it, just got to do click on the X.
